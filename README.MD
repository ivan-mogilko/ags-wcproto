# First-person space-sim prototype done in AGS

This project is a prototype of a first-person space simulator game made in [Adventure Game Studio](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/).
Was made in AGS 3.4.3, but may be opened in later ones too, at least up to AGS 3.6.0.

The idea was to script a 3D software renderer in AGS script, capable of displaying sprites & particles, and similating a "space combat".
The 3D render and matrix math code is based on original code posted on AGS forums by [@KhrisMuc](https://github.com/KhrisMuc), then refactored and adjusted, keeping OpenGL docs as a reference.

To be fair, this is not the best thing to do in AGS script, as it's rather slow compared to other scripting languages out there.
Also, the game script may be written not in an optimal way.

This game project never progressed past very early prototype, does not feature much, and has some 3D render bugs.
I release it for two reasons: 1) code samples, and 2) it's suitable for performance tests in AGS engine.

Personally, I do not have any further plans for this project, and won't accept contributions rather than obvious bug fixes. But the code is free to use under [Creative Commons 4.0 BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
